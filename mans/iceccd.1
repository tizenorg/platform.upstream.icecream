.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
The Icecream daemon has to run on all nodes being part of the Icecream compile cluster\&. It receives compile jobs and executes them in a chroot environment\&. The compile clients send their compile environment the first time they send a job to a particular daemon, so that the environment of the daemon doesn't have to match the one of the client\&.

.PP
The daemon also has to run on clients sending compile jobs to the Icecream network\&. If a node should be able to send compile jobs, but never receive any, start the daemon with the option \-m 0\&.

.PP
All Icecream daemons need to have contact to the Icecream scheduler which controls the distribution of data between compile nodes\&. Normally the daemon will automatically find the right scheduler\&. If this is not the case you can explicitly specify the name of the Icecream network and the host running the scheduler\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-n\fR \fInetname\fR
The name of the icecream network the daemon should connect to\&. There has to be a scheduler running for the network under the same network name\&.

.TP
\fB\-m\fR \fImax_processes\fR
Maximum number of compile jobs started in parallel on machine running the daemon\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-no\-remote\fR
Prevents jobs from other nodes being scheduled on this one\&.

.TP
\fB\-w\fR


.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-daemonize\fR
Detach daemon from shell\&.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fIlogfile\fR
Name of file where log output is written to\&.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fIscheduler_host\fR
Name of host running the scheduler for the network the daemon should connect to\&. This option might help if the scheduler can't broadcast its presence to the clients due to firewall settings or similar reasons\&.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-vv\fR, \fB\-vvv\fR
Control verbosity of daemon\&. The more v the more verbose\&.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-run\-as\-user\fR
Force running the daemon with user rights\&. Usually you will need to run the daemon with root rights\&.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR \fIenv_basedir\fR
Base directory for storing compile environments sent to the daemon by the compile clients\&.

.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-nobody\-uid\fR \fInobodyuid\fR
Id of user nobody\&. This user id is used when the daemon is dropping privileges\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-cache\-limit\fR \fIMB\fR
Maximum size in Mega Bytes of cache used to store compile environments of compile clients\&.

.TP
\fB\-N\fR \fIhostname\fR
The name of the icecream host on the network\&.
